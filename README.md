# The Goat Ad Blocker

<p>It's not an ad blocker, it's a goat parasite.</p>

<p>Everytime you open a browser, a goat appears in the middle of the screen and moves at an atrocious pace.</p>

<p>It also replaces every single image element with such goat. It also has a popup which has a "lifetime ad counter". It's just a number that goes up when the interval is allowed.</p>
